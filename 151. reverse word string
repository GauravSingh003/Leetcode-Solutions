// Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

var reverseWords = function(s) {
    let arr = s.split(" ");

    let reversed = ' ';
    for(let i = arr.lrngth -1; i>=0; i--){
        if(arr[i] == '') continue;
        if(reversed.length >0) reversed += ' ';
        reversed += arr[i];
    }
    return reversed
};


Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
Example 2:

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
Example 3:

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
